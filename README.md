Senior Group Project in Database Design

This Project uses a twitter scraper to scrape thousands of tweets and process them using SPARK to provide a complete sentiment analysis.
This analysis is then stored into a Cassandra Clustered Database directly from Spark. The database is then used to generate heatmaps as a google maps overlay to show how particular areas feel based on the tweets scraped.
